      <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
      <p>HTML is the basic <em>language of the web</em>. It is used to create web pages and web applications. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create the structure of a web page. HTML is made up of elements. Elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. An element is a piece of content in a web page. Elements are surrounded by tags. Tags are used to mark up HTML elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag marks the beginning of an element. The closing tag marks the end of an element. The content of an element is placed between the opening and closing tags. Here is an example of an HTML element:</p>
      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
        
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        
        In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
        
        The opening tag
        The closing tag
        The actual element
